# Benchmarking

```{r}

# Loop 1:100 => Test following strategy 100 times in order to assess statistics about algorithms behaviour

# Create random vector of size 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6 (Choose one size for complete experiment)

# Time Quick Sort and Merge Sort respectively

# Measure and save time

# Make statistics of measurements
